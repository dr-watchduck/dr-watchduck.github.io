He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as a leading musician of his era, whose “poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.” Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin">Source: Wikipedia</a></p> </body> </html>
